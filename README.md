# Sports Event Calendar

This is my front-end coding project for the Sportradar.

## Project Overview

This web app shows sports events for November 2025 and a list of upcoming matches.
Users can click on a day to see games and add new events using a simple form.
All new events stay saved after reloading the page using  **localStorage**.

## Features

- Calendar for November 2025
- Red dot on days with matches
- Add  new events( date, time, sport, teams, result)
- Data saved with localStorage
- Responsive design with dark theme and navy blue color

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - structure
- **CSS** - design and animation
- **JavaScript** - calendar logic and data handling
  
## Setup

1. Download or clone this respository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. The calendar and matches will load automatically.

## AI Reflection

I used ChatGPT only for small help for example,
to learn how to use **localStorage** and to find a good navy blue color for the design.
I tested and wrote the final code myself.
For more details, see the **AI_Reflection.txt** file.
